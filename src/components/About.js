                Soothing beauty, offbeat tourist’s attractions, spiritual ambiance, the sacred river, humble people, and zealous culture, Assam boasts plenty of fascinating secrets. Being one of the Northeast India’s iconic seven sisters, a holiday in Assam is about witnessing a heady mix of history, culture, and nature at the same time. The state happens to be the land of many wildlife reserves, which are further home to the one-horned rhino, one of Assam's tourism best-known mascots.
                Assam has a diversified background. The state owes its name to the Ahom Dynasty that has ruled over it for quite a long time. One can even see the traces of the state in the books and journals that speak about Aryan, Dravidians, Alpines, Tibetan and Burmese history. Even after so many years, cultures of these dynasties season the culinary aromas on Assam's streets, the often exotic clothing people wear and the music they listen to. An integral part of Assamese culture is its tribal population, mainly the Bodo tribe and Mishing tribe. To get to know the tribes a little better, one should go for a tribal tour in Assam, and make a point to get hands on classy bamboo products like mats, baskets, and handheld fans. Assam is a bespoke shopping destination. The famous Pat silk, Muga silk, Eri silk and Endi cloth of Assam has left its indelible mark not only saree lovers but on the younger generation as well.</p>
